Explanation
	1.	setcookie(name, value, expire)
	•	Sends an HTTP header telling the browser to store a cookie.
	•	Must occur before any HTML is output.

	2.	$_COOKIE
	•	Holds all cookies sent back by the browser.
	•	Note: newly set cookies become available on the next page load.

	3.	Expiration
	•	time() + 3600 sets the cookie to live for one hour.
	•	To delete, set expire to a timestamp in the past.

	4.	Use Cases & Caveats
	•	Good for “remember me” features, UI preferences, or non-sensitive tracking.
	•	Stored client-side—users can view/modify unless you use HTTP-only flags.


cookie_example.php
Here, cookies are managed through HTTP headers sent by the script. First, setcookie() creates a cookie named ‘user’ with the value “John” that 
will expire in one hour. On the next request, $_COOKIE['user'] can be read to retrieve that value. The script then overwrites the cookie 
with “Jane” by calling setcookie() again, and finally deletes it by setting its expiration time to a moment in the past. Cookies travel with 
every request and response, making them useful for remembering user preferences or simple tokens.
