Explanation
	1.	file_put_contents() / file_get_contents()
	•	Handy wrappers around lower-level file functions (fopen, fread, fwrite).
	•	FILE_APPEND flag adds to existing content instead of replacing it.

	2.	unlink()
	•	Deletes the specified file from the filesystem.

	3.	JSON Handling
	•	json_encode() converts a PHP array/object into a JSON string.
	•	json_decode(..., true) parses JSON back into a PHP associative array.

	4.	Use Cases
	•	Flat-file storage for simple data, logs, or configuration.
	•	Lightweight alternative when a full database isn’t needed.

  file_operations.php
This script illustrates basic file I/O and JSON handling. It writes the string “Hello” to file.txt, reads and echoes its contents, 
appends “\nWorld” to the same file, and then deletes it with unlink(). It then shows JSON serialization by encoding an associative 
array with a name key into data.json, reading that file back, decoding it into a PHP array, and echoing the name value. Together, these 
operations demonstrate how to store and retrieve both plain text and structured JSON data without a database.
