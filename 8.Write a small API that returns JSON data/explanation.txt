Explanation
	1.	header('Content-Type: application/json')
	•	Informs the client (browser or app) that the response body is JSON, not HTML.

	2.	json_encode()
	•	Converts PHP arrays or objects into a JSON-formatted string.

	3.	Use Cases
	•	Backend API endpoints consumed by JavaScript apps, mobile apps, or other services.
	•	Always set appropriate CORS headers if serving cross-domain.


  api.php
This minimal API endpoint begins by sending an HTTP header to declare that the response will be JSON (application/json). 
It then defines a PHP array with a status and user, converts it into a JSON-formatted string using json_encode(), and echoes 
that string. Front‐end applications or other clients can fetch this URL, parse the JSON, and use the data programmatically, cleanly 
separating backend logic from presentation.
