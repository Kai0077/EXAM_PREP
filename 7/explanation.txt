Explanation
	1.	try { … } catch (ExceptionType $e) { … }
	•	Run the code in try. If an exception of the specified type is thrown, control passes to catch.

	2.	PDOException
	•	Thrown by PDO when a database operation fails (e.g. wrong credentials or host).

	3.	getMessage()
	•	Retrieves the human-readable error message.
	•	Always handle exceptions gracefully to avoid exposing sensitive details in production.

	4.	Best Practices
	•	Catch only the exceptions you expect.
	•	Log errors to a file or monitoring system instead of echoing in production.


  error_handling.php
In order to handle potential database connection errors gracefully, this code wraps the PDO constructor in a try block. 
If the connection fails—for example, due to incorrect credentials or an unreachable host—a PDOException is thrown and caught
by the catch block, which then echoes a brief error message from $e->getMessage(). This ensures the script does not crash abruptly 
and provides informative feedback about what went wrong.
