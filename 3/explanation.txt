session_example.php
This example starts by calling session_start(), which either creates a new session or resumes an existing one on the server. 
It then demonstrates writing to $_SESSION by storing the string “John” under the key ‘username’, reading that value back to display it, 
updating it to “Jane,” and eventually calling unset() to remove it entirely. Because session data lives on the server, it persists across 
multiple page loads for the same user until the session expires or is destroyed.
