polymorphism.php
Using an abstract base class Animal with an abstract speak() method, this example requires every subclass (such as Cat and Dog) to 
implement its own version of speak(). An array is constructed containing a Cat instance and a Dog instance, and a loop calls speak() on 
each object. This demonstrates polymorphism: you can treat different objects through the same interface (Animal), yet each one behaves 
according to its specific implementation.
