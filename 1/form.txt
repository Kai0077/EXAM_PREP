form.php
This script begins by checking whether the current request arrived via POST by examining $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']. 
If it is a POST, it safely retrieves the ‘name’ and ‘email’ fields from $_POST, sanitizes them with htmlspecialchars() 
to strip out any malicious HTML or scripts, and then prints a friendly greeting using those values. If the form has not 
yet been submitted, the HTML form is rendered, and the required attributes ensure the browser enforces basic input validation 
before allowing submission.
